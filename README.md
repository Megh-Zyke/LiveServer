# Flask Video Streaming App
This is a simple Flask web application for streaming video from your computer's camera. It captures video frames using OpenCV and serves them as a continuous stream to a web page. This project is a great starting point for building video streaming applications using Flask and OpenCV.

  ----

## Features
  * Live video streaming from your computer's camera.
  * Minimalistic web interface for viewing the stream.
  * Easily customizable and extendable for your own projects.
